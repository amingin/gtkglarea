Here is Windows port of GtkGLArea, or at least a good start of it. It
has been contributed by  Andrew Marriott <raytrace@lillee.cs.curtin.edu.au>,
thank you Andrew.

Warning: I haven't compiled any of it!! I tried to compile glib and
gtk+ under cygwin (it is very nice unix'ish development envinronment,
definetly a must if you have to use Windows) but I failed miserably.

I might try again once ./configure works on Windows port of gtk+ !!


- Originally this code was developed under Microsoft C.

- Port uses X11 and GLX emulation code from glut by Nate Robins.

- I don't like the way Windows and X11 specific portions are in
  the same file, first task to do would be to separate Windows
  specific code to it's own source files so that X11 code does
  not need to be touched at all. (nuke #ifdef'ed X11 code from
  files in win32 directory). Ideally only gdkgl.c needs to be
  different.

- Windows uses lazy evaluation, gl context is really created when
  gdk_gl_make_current is called first time, for this reason attribute
  list needs to be saved to GdkGLContextPrivate --> gtkglarea widget needs
  to pass attrlist to gdk_gl_area_share_new, I have already put these
  changes to main gtkglarea.

- Not all gdk_gl_* functions are ported, just enough to use GtkGLArea
  widget, gtk_gl_pixmap_* and gdk_gl_use_gdk_font functions are
  X11 specific and unportable (prove me wrong by sending code!)

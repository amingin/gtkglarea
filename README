INTRODUCTION
------------

 GtkGLArea is an OpenGL widget for GTK+ GUI toolkit.

 Just as GTK+ is build on top of GDK, GtkGLArea is built on top of gdkgl which
 is basically wrapper around GLX functions. The widget itself is derived
 from GtkDrawinigArea widget and adds only few extra functions.

 Lower level gdkgl functions make it easy to render on any widget that has
 OpenGL capable visual, rendering to off-screen pixmaps is also supported. 

 Related project which may iterest those who use GTK-- is GtkGLArea--. It is a
 C++ wrapper for gtkglarea written by Karl Nelson <kenelson@ece.ucdavis.edu>. 


INSTALLATION
------------

 You need GTK+ and either OpenGL or Mesa, if you have both you can choose which
 one to use by giving --with-lib-GL or --with-lib-MesaGL option to configure.

 Run './configure --help' to see all options you may give at configuration stage.
 Run './configure' and 'make' to build. You may now test programs in examples
 directory. Run 'make install' to install.

 Include files go to PREFIX/include/gtkgl/
 Library files go to PREFIX/lib/


WIN32
-----

 There is now a working windows port. autoconfig is not used, but you probably
 don't want to use it anyway. It has only been tested with mingw32.

 You will of course need win32 gtk+ packages in addition to mingw32.

   glib-dev-19991218.zip
   gtk+-dev-20000104.zip
   extralibs-dev-19991218.zip

 you can get these from http://www.iki.fi/tml/gimp/win32/ installation
 instructions (README.win32) are long and complicated, but you can
 ingnore about half of them (I did).

 OpenlGL headers and (dev) libraries for mingw32 are also needed, grab

   Mingw32_OpenGL.zip

 from ftp://ftp.teleport.com/pub/users/pgarceau/

 or alternatively you may use

  glut-cygwin.zip

 from http://www.cim.pe.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kawachi/software/cygwin_glut-e.html

 Unzip these packages to some directory, then modify GTKDIR and OGLDIR
 in makefile.cygwin to point to correct directories. Now you should be all
 set to compile with

   make -f makefile.cygwin

 This should produce libgtkgl.a in gtkgl directory and two examples simple.exe
 and viewlw.exe in examples directory. Windows version of viewlw is a bit shaky
 but should show example *.lwo objects if their file names are given from
 command line. Other examples do not compile at this time. (Pixmaps and fonts are
 unsupported in win32).

 Inner workings of win32 gtkglarea is quite different form glx version, therefore
 you should only use GtkGLArea widget (gtk_gl_*) functions, no gdk_gl_* functions.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

 Documentation is slightly out of date, sorry.

 docs/gtkglarea.txt	documents GtkGLArea widget (needs updating)
 docs/gtkgl.txt		documents gtk_gl_* functions (needs updating)
 docs/HOWTO.txt		good advice

TODO
----

 - rewrite documentation in texinfo format
 - weed out bugs from autoconfigure scripts
 - overlays
 - add more functionality to windows port

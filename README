INTRODUCTION
------------

 GtkGLArea is an OpenGL widget for GTK+ GUI toolkit.

 Just as GTK+ is build on top of GDK, GtkGLArea is built on top of gdkgl which
 is basically wrapper around GLX functions. The widget itself is derived
 from GtkDrawinigArea widget and adds only few extra functions.

 Lower level gdkgl functions make it easy to render on any widget that has
 OpenGL capable visual, rendering to off-screen pixmaps is also supported. 

 Related project which may iterest those who use GTK-- is GtkGLArea--. It is a
 C++ wrapper for gtkglarea written by Karl Nelson <kenelson@ece.ucdavis.edu>. 


INSTALLATION
------------

 You need GTK+ and either OpenGL or Mesa, if you have both you can choose which one to
 use by giving --with-lib-GL or --with-lib-MesaGL option to configure.

 Run './configure --help' to see all options you may give at configuration stage.
 Run './configure' and 'make' to build. You may now test programs in examples
 directory. Run 'make install' to install.

 Include files go to PREFIX/include/gtkgl/
 Library files go to PREFIX/lib/


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

 docs/gtkglara.txt	documents GtkGLArea widget
 docs/gtkgl.txt		documents gtk_gl_* functions
 docs/HOWTO.txt		good advice

 It is a good idea to read GLX manpages too!
